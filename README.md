# kObjects.org

Kobjects.org was created in the early 2000s as a namepace umbrella for some MIDP-related projects, most notably kxml2. 

The original "idea" behind the name was "Kilobyte Objects". Currently we seem to be pivoting towards "Kotlin Objects".

## Projects

- [konsole](http://github.com/kobjects/konsole) A chat-like KMP "console" interface.
- [kxml2](https://github.com/kobjects/kxml2) A lightweight "pull" parser for XML.
- [kxml3](https://github.com/kobjects/kxml3) Kxml2 ported to Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)

For an overview of current projects, please refer to the [github project page](https://github.com/kobjects)

## Legacy Projects

- ksoap2 is now maintained by [simpligility](http://simpligility.github.io/ksoap2-android/index.html)
- [ME4SE](http://me4se.org) implements the MIDP API for the Java Standard Edition.
